# Coding Katas

This repository contains a collection of coding katas used to practice
problem-solving, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and clean code principles.

The focus is not on algorithmic cleverness, but on:
- incremental design
- readability and maintainability
- explicit testing
- refactoring with confidence

Each kata is implemented as a small, self-contained Python module.

---

## Goals

- Practice writing code using TDD
- Improve code clarity and naming
- Explore design trade-offs in small problems
- Build an interview-ready portfolio of well-structured solutions

---

## Structure

Each kata lives in its own directory and includes:
- the implementation
- a test suite
- a short README describing the approach and decisions
